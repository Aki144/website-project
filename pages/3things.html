      <h3>
    Website: Geocities
  </h3>
    <p>
      GeoCities led the web hosting industry in allowing users to publish and create websites for free. Visitors were able to browse user-created websites according to their interests. GeoCities was founded by David Bohnett and John Rezner in November 1994.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geocities offered a lot of features. The 15MB of space might seem small by today's standards, but in the '90s it was downright extravagant. As well, Geocities came bundled with some easy-to-use site templates (and later drag-and-drop tools). It hit all the right notes. It was simple, fast, and free. Many people were trying to figure out what the web is, nevermind their place within it. People found comfort in it. It reaffirmed that you deserved a place on the wonderful web.
</p>
    <p>
      Even the fact that GeoCities inspired a lot of horrible Web design doesn't seem so bad now. The site allowed users to do amazing things with just a few clicks - without much training, anyone could add music, animation, graphics, and other HTML wizardry. Despite being a pioneer, GeoCities was firmly of its time and place.

      Person: Tim Berners-Lee
</h3>
    <p>
      Sir Tim Berners-Lee (also known as the "Godfather of the Internet") changed the world by inventing the World Wide Web. Having made the web available for free to all, he unleashed a wave of creativity, collaboration, and innovation like no other.
</p>
    <p>
      Internet access has opened up new horizons for millions of people around the globe. A person's quality of life can be improved through the internet. A global network of billions of computers. Almost any kind of information can be accessed via the Internet, and you can communicate with anyone in the world. On the other hand, the internet is a breeding ground for trolling, cyberbullying, stalking, etc. It is possible for some people to commit cybercrimes. Scamming, hacking, identity theft, and stealing data are forms of online fraud.
</p>
    <p>
      The internet has been an important element of information for society since the beginning of modern times. It is a source of information that society can access easily and a means of disseminating knowledge. Information has also long been regarded as a real resource, one that consistently enables you and me to contribute to a better quality of life. World has been changed forever by the internet.

      Technology: HTML
</h3>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a document for web browsing. Markup helps web browsers to determine how to render text and images on a webpage.
</p>
    <p>
      The Internet is navigated using HyperText. A hyperlink is a special type of text that takes users to a new page when clicked. Users can travel anywhere on the Web simply by clicking on the available links because hyperlinks are not linear. The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML.
</p>
    <p>
      HTML can be divided into three types: transitional, strict, and frameset. The transitional type of HTML is the most popular, while the strict type of HTML is meant to return rules to HTML and make it more reliable. With Frameset, Web developers can create a mosaic of HTML documents and a menu system. In strict HTML, rules are turned into HTML and it is more reliable. The strict type, for example, requires closing all tags for all opened tags. On phones, where the processing power may be limited, this style of HTML is critical.
</p>
    <p>
      A website can be created with HTML, or HyperText Markup Language. In spite of having code words and syntax like any other language, the language is relatively easy to understand and becomes increasingly powerful as time passes. The World Wide Web Consortium, which designs and maintains HTML, announces the move to Web 2.0 as HTML continues to evolve to meet the needs and demands of the Internet.
